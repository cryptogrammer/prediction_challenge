Clover Prediction Challenge
========================

Winner gets a $1000 price. Solid entries get a priority interview at Clover. Details here: https://www.clover.com/challenge

Weâ€™re challenging you to help us predict how busy one of our merchants will be in 30 minutes, 3 hours, etc., in order to help them better anticipate things like wait times, stock counts, employee counts, opening hours and even eventually integrate this knowledge into systems like OpenTable or Yelp.

In the data directory are files containing the order creation times for a few sample merchants. You can consider this as test/training data. We will be using additional merchants for evaluation. 

Note: These times are in GMT.

We can also tell you a rough location for each merchant, so feel free to use this data to include any additional information such as holidays, events, or weather.

```
Merchant A - California (Southern)
Merchant B - Connecticut (Coastal)
Merchant C - Florida (Central)
Merchant D - Massachusetts (Southern) 
Merchant E - Oregon (Northern)
```

To play: Fork our repo, and issue a pull request when you're ready to submit. Include a description of what your approach was, what exactly you estimated, and of course your code.
